# TPSS-LannisterPay
This project is an assessment to implement an API for a payment splitting service. 

A payment splitting service simply gives room for a merchant to pay a specific amount through different channels. A set of computuation rules were provided to achieve this result

## Thought Process
It is expected that I use the spscified computuation rules to give the resulting split payments.

Steps
- Create moodels
- Route the models and perform POST request
- Apply computuation rules
- Deploy API
- Debug errors and submit link.

## Solution so far

Features, Packages and Dependences Installed
- Node JS
- NPM: Used to manage packages for a project
- Express: Simplifies the process of building packages
- Nodemon: to adjust changes to be made.
- Mongoose: used when creating modules.
